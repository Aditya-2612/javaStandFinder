Java Stand Finder is an attempt to improve (both informationally and functionally) online maps.

It uses the Google Maps API with custom data and icons to present the user with their nearest Java stands, 
and through implicit icons, denotes whether those stands are family-friendly or not.

Future versions should include:

-A proper database of java stands
-A marker to show the user's position
-The ability for users to add stands, or at the very least submit addresses to then be vetted by the host
-The ability to review Java stands

Java Stand Finder is currently live at http://javastandfinder.com and uses HTML5 geolocation.
